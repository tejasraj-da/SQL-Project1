# SQL-Project1
This is my SQL project to build the "skeleton" of an e-commerce.I designed all the tables for users, products, and orders. I figured out how to link them together using primary and foreign keys. I also built a special order_items table to handle the tricky part of connecting many products to many orders. Running the schema.sql file will build the whole database structure.
